### Overview

Currently, installation of LivePerson Applications is performed by LivePerson's internal resources (account team, DevSupport, Tier 1, etc). In order to request this installation, you must first fill out the following schema according to your application needs. Once that is done, please contact the relevant LivePerson resource for your account and they will perform the installation.

Once the application has been installed, the LivePerson resource will send you your Client ID  and secret ID which are required for OAuth2.0 authentication. In the future, installing an application will be possible on your own through the Applications dashboard, but currently the installation process must be followed.
